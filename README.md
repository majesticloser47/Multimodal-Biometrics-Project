## Overview

This project aims to demonstrate and experiment with multimodal biometric systems, which integrate multiple biometric authentication methods (such as face, fingerprint, voice, etc.) for enhanced security and reliability.

## Features

- Modular codebase for adding or removing biometric modalities
- Example notebooks for data processing, feature extraction, and fusion strategies
- Performance evaluation scripts and visualization tools

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/majesticloser47/Multimodal-Biometrics-Project.git
   cd Multimodal-Biometrics-Project
   ```

2. **(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Open the Jupyter Notebook environment:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Browse the notebooks and follow the instructions within each notebook to run experiments or demonstrations.
